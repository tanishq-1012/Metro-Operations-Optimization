# Metro-Operations-Optimization

## Overview

Metro Operations Optimization refers to the systematic process of enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of Metro services through various data-driven techniques and operational adjustments.
This project focuses on optimizing the operations of the Delhi Metro using Python. It utilizes General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to analyze metro routes, stop locations, trip schedules, and frequency distributions. The project provides insights into metro coverage, trip distributions, stop density, and optimized scheduling based on time-of-day demand.

## Features

**GTFS Data Processing**: Load and analyze various GTFS datasets such as routes, trips, stops, and stop_times.

**Geographical Visualization**:

Plot Delhi Metro routes on a map.

Visualize metro stop locations.

Highlight the number of routes passing through each stop.

**Trip Analysis**:

Count and visualize the number of trips per day of the week.

Analyze the time intervals between metro trips at different stops.

Categorize trips into different time intervals (Morning Peak, Midday, Evening Peak, etc.).

**Schedule Optimization**:

Adjust trip frequencies based on demand during peak and off-peak hours.

Compare original vs. optimized schedules for efficiency improvements.
